# Introduction

Organ transplantation is a critical component of modern healthcare, offering life-saving interventions for patients with 
end-stage organ failure. However, the process of organ procurement, where we have donor referral to successful retrieval, 
is influenced by a complex interplay of medical, logistical, and systemic factors. Despite ongoing efforts to improve 
equity and efficiency in organ donation, disparities persist across racial, socioeconomic, and geographic lines, raising 
concerns about fairness and resource allocation.
