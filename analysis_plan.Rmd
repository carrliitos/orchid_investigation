Absolutely. Here's a structured **analysis plan** for **Objective #1: Disparities in Organ Procurement Outcomes**:

---

### **Objective 1: Analyze Disparities in Organ Procurement Outcomes**

#### üîç **Goal**

### **1. Define the Outcome and Exposure Variables**

* **Outcome Variable**

  * `organ_procured` (binary): 1 if organ was successfully procured, 0 otherwise.
  * Optional: stratify by organ type (e.g., kidney, liver).

* **Primary Exposure Variables**

  * **Race/Ethnicity** (e.g., White, Black, Hispanic, Other)
  * **Socioeconomic Proxy**: Hospital or referral region as a proxy; if available, use donor zip code linked to area deprivation index.
  * **Geography**: OPO region or donor state.

* **Covariates (for adjustment)**

  * Age
  * Sex
  * Cause of death
  * Time from referral to declaration
  * Clinical indicators (to control for potential confounding)

---

### **2. Descriptive Statistics**

* Tabulate procurement success rates by:
  * Race/ethnicity
  * OPO region
  * Socioeconomic proxy
* Use bar charts or mosaic plots to visualize differences.
* Calculate unadjusted procurement rates (%) and 95% confidence intervals per group.

---

### **3. Unadjusted Analysis**

* **Chi-squared tests** or **Fisher‚Äôs exact tests** to test associations between procurement success and:

  * Race/ethnicity
  * OPO region
  * Socioeconomic proxy

* **Risk Ratios (RR)** or **Odds Ratios (OR)** from 2x2 tables comparing procurement rates by group.

---

### **4. Adjusted Analysis**

* Fit a **multivariable logistic regression model**:

```r
glm(organ_procured ~ race + sex + age + region + socioeconomic_proxy + cause_of_death + key_clinical_vars, 
    data = orchid_data, family = "binomial")
```

* Report:

  * Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for race, region, and SES
  * 95% confidence intervals
  * p-values

* Use **marginal effects** or **predicted probabilities** to better interpret findings for policy discussions.

---

### **5. Sensitivity Analyses**

* Repeat analysis:

  * Stratified by organ type (e.g., kidney only).
  * Excluding patients with missing key clinical predictors.
  * Using alternate SES proxies if available (e.g., donor hospital rural/urban indicator).

---

### **6. Equity Gap Quantification (Optional)**

* Compute **absolute risk differences** (ARD) between highest and lowest groups.
* Use **Fairness metrics** (e.g., demographic parity ratio) if interested in ML framing.

---

### **7. Output and Reporting**

* Create tables for:

  * Descriptive statistics
  * Logistic regression output
* Create figures:

  * Forest plots of aORs
  * Choropleth maps of OPO-level procurement rates (if geocoded)
